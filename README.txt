This only example commands for code snippets in Iframe in blogger.

That is a django project where we can locally run a django application for CMS and then generate or publish these models through different services. 
Like blogger, Firebase ( static pages ) Firebase sync with Firebase DB etc.. This way we keep our data central and can publish it where we need it. 
The objective is to make data easily portable and to automate content creation and update via various Google services. Here we will place several scripts needed for publications of average sites 1000 + pages. These scripts can then also be used for migrations. 
From Wordpress to Blogger or from Wordpress to static hosting from Firebase so that further development becomes easier. 
If you want you can use it for small business websites but in my opinion there are better CMS for these purposes. 
We only make it because we need minimal application and power of django commands so we can extend application fairly quickly in our usual environment. 
So, we use brand new technology in combination with a stable and smart working environment.
